Change the PJ (project) files and see how this affects the DT (output) files. Compare between windows and linux versions

changing the date in the windows GUI does nothing. No way at present of inserting date. Can only change data in climate file ie delete parts of data

default- Defaults from CenW4.0 GUI
harv and thin- Default harv and thinning from CenW 3.1 GUI
ourclim- Putting in our climate file from grid 18763109
