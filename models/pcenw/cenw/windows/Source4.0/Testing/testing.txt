RUNS- ALL IN WINDOWS

default harvest and thinning=thinning from CenW 3.1 GUI


cenw_default_windows - used in windows linux comparison. all original .ie no mgmt and default cl.
**************************

30 years
our climate
start 1972

CenWco2.dt- co2.en! also use our climate and no mgmt
CenWirr.dt - turn on default irrigation (99% of capicity daily)
cenwfert.dt- 500 n yr=1 from beginning of run
ourclime_win.dt - default with our climate
CenWharv_thin_win.dt- With pruning and thinning from 3.1 defaults. ie use "default_thinning31.hv!"


Same thing done on climate starting 90 years after original date 1972+90 ie with the most global warming

co2_90
irr_90
fert_90
CenW90.DT!

********************
climate simulations
30 years
start various years
no mgmt

cenw ourclim
15_win - 15 years in ie delete first 15 years of our climate file
30

*****************


RUN for 100 YEARS
our climate
starting in various years

our_100
2000_100
2030_100

then also with thinning and pruning
our_100_thin
2000_100_thin
2030_100_thin
****************

nl= point in northland
cenw_nl.dt- default 30 years
cenw_nl_thin.dt - default harvest and thinning

*******************************


thinning_only.hv- thinning only

***********************


nl_prune- no harvest
nl_prune_30- harvest at 30 years
...

change the simulation to 100 years and try changing the age of harvest to see if the former part of the data stays the same with the same pruning regime
If it changes suggests that there is forward looking aspect to model or there is plently of static.
