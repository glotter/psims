Testing CO2 in CenW

*****************88
No, changing CO2 has always be part of the model. There are three options:
1)	Under ‘Weather parameters’ you can set a CO2 concentration.
2)	You can also read CO2 concentrations as part of your weather file. You need to indicate that this is what you want to do under ‘Files’ – ‘Read weather data’. That way, you can change the CO2 concentration every day. CO2 cocnentration read in that way would OVER-RIDE the value set under 1)
3)	However, since CO2 does not change daily, it is usually more convenient to specify CO2 conecentrations with a new environment setting under ‘Events’ – ‘Environment’. That is where you can change CO2 at an annual time step (or whatever you choose). CO2 concentrations specified here are ADDED to those given under 1) or 2).

I generally always use options 1) in combination with 3). For other environmental changes, it may be warranted to change them on a daily basis, or at least monthly or seasonally, 
which can be implemented through an external routine and then fed to CenW through the climate file. If you do that, it might be convenient to calculate CO2 as well, but not necessary. 
There are several options, and they all work. It is just a matter of selecting what’s most convenient for a specific project.

We want this co2 to be implemented in the linux version of CenW.
We know that cenw will run with a co2 column in the climate file when the paramters above are turned on or off. 

1) check to see that CenW will run with new CO2 sepcified in cl file in windows
2) Same in linux. for this we need a new pj file which sets the input to include co2 conc and removes default co2
	C:\Work\CenW\CenW_SVN\windows\Source4.0\Testing\Output\CO2\CO2.xlsx
	here we calc the % difference between the linux and the windows version of CenW when we change the .pj file in order to make sure that we know how to change the co2 in the linux version

Now we need to write some code that will take the .CL file and add a column with the co2 conc in it. DO THIS IN SWIFT??? TALK TO JOSHUA
