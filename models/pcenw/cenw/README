These folders contain several versions of the CenW source code:
  windows/FullSourceCode/ is the windows delphi v3.1
  windows/Source4.0/ is the windows delphi v4.0
  cmdapp/ is the free pascal version successfully compiled and run on PADS
  test3/ is an intermediate workspace produced during the conversion from 
    delphi to fpc.

It also contains a set of test suite of CenW I/O files called test_suite/testX

It also contains reparam.sh which is just a code stub for now that's 
  included here because we plan to use it (or similar) to generate the 
  parameter files using a tag and replace model.
