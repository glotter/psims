This folder contains campaign and model specific input files that often 
need to be edited to perform different experiments on management, cultivars, 
crops, etc. There is one folder for each model which typically contains a 
folder of "common" files, which are files that are needed for all runs. 
The standard example of common files are the crop parameter files which 
include all the cultivar options and parameterizations. Each model folder 
also includes a number of experiment subfolders, which contain Campaign.nc4 
files, template files, params files, and other experiment specific stuff. 

Also in the campaign/ folder is a generic set of previously used params 
files under campaign/params/, in case these might be useful for future 
work. Alot of these have been deprecated so use with caution.
