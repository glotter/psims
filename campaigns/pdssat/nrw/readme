gridlist file is /data/gridlists/other/nrw.grid.all

because the experiment is so simple that there is nothing changing spatially, and because the grid_ids are all messed up by the fact that they never told us the actual damn longitudes. 


Initial conditions:
	initial soil water per layer
layer 1a	50% of FC
layer 1b	50% of FC
layer 2		50% of FC
layer 3		50% of FC
 
Output variables:
Variable	Unit	Remarks
Yield		t DM/ha	-
Total above ground biomass	t DM/ha	-
Total ET over the growing season  mm/growing season	Indicate which method has been used to calculate ET and PET
Total intercepted PAR over the growing season 		MJ/ha/growing season  -
Maximum LAI during the growing season  m2/m2		-
Anthesis date	   DOY Indicate if it is a fixed value or simulated per year
Harvest date	   DOY Indicate if maturity date is meant and if it is a fixed value or simulated per year
